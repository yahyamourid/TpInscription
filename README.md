# Student Management System
The Student Management System is a comprehensive application designed to manage student data efficiently. It consists of a backend developed with Spring Boot,
a web frontend built using React and Tailwind CSS, and a mobile app created with Java in Android Studio.



## Web Frontend
### Web Frontend Overview
Our web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing student data efficiently. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling and customization a breeze.
### Technologies Used
- **React**:React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently.
- **TailwindCss**:Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for building custom designs without leaving your HTML markup.
